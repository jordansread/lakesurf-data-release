  Data release: Deep learning estimates and observations of lake surface temperatures (1980-2020) for the Continental U.S.


abstract: >-
  The data release of daily lake surface temperatures comprises 185,550 lakes across the continental United States from
  1980 to 2020 that are generated using an entity-aware long short-term memory deep learning model. In-situ measurements
  used for model training spanned a subset of 12,253 lakes. Model training was optimized for prediction on unmonitored
  lakes through a cross validation framework. Median per-lake estimated error found through cross validation on lakes with
  in-situ surface temperature observations was 1.198 °C.  The generated dataset will be beneficial for a wide range of
  applications including estimations of thermal habitats and the impacts of climate change on inland lakes.
